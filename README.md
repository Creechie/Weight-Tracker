# Weight Tracker

An online application for tracking calories consumed and weight loss/gain.
Made to replace, simplify, and expand bulky spreadsheets and pen-and-paper recording.

## Features

* Calculates what I'm calling a "Rolling TDEE Value" (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).
  * The app will start you off with an estimate of the amount of calories you should consume each day to achieve you personal goal.
  * Over time, as more data is entered, this estimate gets more and more accurate as it adjusts on the fly to your calorific intake and weight fluxuations.
* Graphs that give valuable insight on progress
* Data importing/exporting makes it possible to quickly tranfer all of your progress if curently using another tool or spreadsheet
